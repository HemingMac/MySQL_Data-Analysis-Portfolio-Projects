**Dany’s Dinner – Case Study (MySQL)**

•	Conducted case study analysis of diner’s member, food and sales data. 

•	In a case study project, I utilized SQL functions like RANK () and DENSE_RANK () for ranking data, applied aggregate functions (COUNT (), SUM (), AVG (), etc.) for summarizing key metrics, and used CTEs to structure complex queries. 

•	I also implemented CASE and ELSEIF for conditional logic and leveraged date functions to filter and manipulate date-related data for more accurate reporting.
